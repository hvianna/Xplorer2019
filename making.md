I have spent many years of my childhood fiddling with an [Apple II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II) computer – playing games,
typing in program listings from magazines, learning from them, and eventually creating my own games.

Back in the 1980s, the term “[code golfing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf)” had not yet been coined,
but [Nibble Magazine](https://www.nibblemagazine.com/) was already running a monthly contest entitled “One- and Two-Liners”,
which challenged programming enthusiasts to create a somewhat useful or amusing program, using just one or two lines of
Applesoft BASIC or [6502](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502) machine language.​

To make the most of such limited resources, programmers would resort to all kinds of hacks and clever tricks,
which usually resulted in some really obscure code. For some reason, that made programming look even more interesting to me.

In July of 1989 my two-liner “Explorer” was one of the winning entries! It was a little game that would put you in control
of a spaceship navigating through a cave full of mines, in search of a lost treasure. If you managed to beat the last level,
the ship would just blink for a few seconds and you’d be congratulated with a “You got it!” message.
It even had some rudimentary sound. I was really proud of it!
